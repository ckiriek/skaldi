BCD-033. Interferon beta-1a biosimilar
Expected authorization in Russia: 2017
Interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a) is a recombinant human interferon beta-1a used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). IFN beta-1a products are a world standard for MS therapy and used as the first-line disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) as they slow down the natural course of MS and delay disability progression by years or decades. 
Table 1. Mechanisms mediating the clinically relevant functions of IFN beta-1a.
Mechanism	Effect of IFN beta-1a	Result	Outcome
Decreasing of cellular autoimmune reactions, inflammation, and demyelination	Reduces expression of MHC II on antigen-presenting cells → reduced antigen presentation and suppressed expression of costimulatory molecules (B7)	Decreased Th-cell clonal expansion	Decreased MS disease activity
    Shifts the cytokine balance	Increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL4 and IL10)	
        Decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ and TNFα)	
    Decreases the release of cytotoxic molecules	Suppressed demyelination	
    Increases NGF synthesis	Astrocyte growth	
    Increases PDGF-β expression 	Immunosuppression	
    Inhibits anti-apoptotic protein (FLIP)	Caspase-8 activation	
Restoring the blood-brain barrier (BBB) function and inhibiting the T-cell infiltration into the CNS	Inhibits the adhesion molecules	Decreased Th-1 migration through the BBB	
    Inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and induces TIMP-1	Reduced damage of the BBB basement membrane	
Antiviral activity	Reduces the viral replication

BCD-033 is the first IFN beta-1a biosimilar that has been developed and manufactured in the Russian Federation. All BCD-033 studies were conducted in direct comparison with the original drug Rebif®. The drug was developed in compliance with the regulatory requirements of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and EMA guidelines.
Proposed therapeutic indications:
Treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
Dosage form: solution for subcutaneous injection 22 µg/0.5 ml or 44 µg/0.5 ml.
Route of administration: Subcutaneously.
Preclinical and clinical data
The drug has been developed in accordance with the international guidelines defining the sufficient data to be submitted in support of interferon beta biosimilars:
    Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products Containing Interferon Beta. (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/652000/2010. 21 February 2013);
    Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence. EMA/CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr ** London, 20 January 2010;


 
Preclinical studies
All BCD-033 preclinical studies were conducted in direct comparison to the original drug Rebif®. It has been shown that IFN beta-1a protein molecules of BCD-033 are equivalent to those of the originator in terms of their physicochemical and biological properties and possess the similar potency.
In vivo preclinical studies and direct comparison with the originator have proved that IFN beta-1a exhibits specific immune-regulating activity and does not show any toxicity non-typical for IFN beta-1a. The PK profile of the biosimilar drug has been shown to be equivalent to that of Rebif®.

Results of BCD-033-1 study
PK analysis.
The IFN-β concentration assessment after a single subcutaneous  injection of study drugs has shown similar PK profiles of BCD-33 and Rebif®.  The PK of two drugs was considered equivalent.

PD analysis
Neopterin and MxA protein concentrations were used as PD markers. The study has shown that the concentrations of both proteins in subjects' blood change similarly after a single dose of either BCD-033 or Rebif®. PD profiles of the test and reference drugs were considered equivalent.

An International, Multicenter, Double-blinded, Placebo-controlled, Randomized Study of the Efficacy and Safety of BCD-033 (JSC BIOCAD, Russia) and Rebif® (Merck Serono S.p.A., Italy) in the Treatment of Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis, Followed by an Open-Label BCD-033 treatment
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02727907  
Study phase III
Status of the study: Ongoing; study subjects are completing the main treatment period. Pending the results.
Study geography: Russia, Ukraine 
Population: The study includes 152 adult DMDs treatment-naive patients who have definite relapsing-remitting MS (McDonald’s criteria, 2010) with EDSS score 5.5 or less, and at least 1 relapse or at least 1 Gd+ MRI lesion within 12 months before randomization.
Study therapy: BCD-033/ Rebif®/placebo, subcutaneous injection of 44 µg/0.5 ml every other day (3 injections per week) after 4-week dose escalation period. 
Over the first 52 weeks of the study, patients randomized to two active study arms received blinded therapy with the BCD-033/Rebif®. Upon 52 weeks (after 48-week full dose treatment), patients are transferred to an open-label period and receive BCD-033 until Week 100. 
Patients randomized to the placebo arm received the placebo over the first 16 weeks of the study, and then are switched to BCD-033 until Week 68.  
Study goals:
To confirm the equivalence of BCD-033 and Rebif® in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS.

Interim analysis results (first 16 weeks of observation)
Efficacy analysis
The main MRI efficacy end point of interim analysis was CUA ealuation after 12 weeks of blinded IFNβ-1a in a full dose or placebo in a full dose. 
The pairwise comparison of each IFN beta-1a arm to the placebo arm revealed significant differences in CUA between IFNβ-1а groups and placebo (p < 0.05). Evaluation of the MRI endpoints has revealed a large number of new and enlarged T2-weighted lesions in the placebo arm, as compared to IFNβ-1а arms.

Figure 6. CUA evaluation after 12 weeks of blinded full-dose IFN beta-1a therapy or full-dose placebo.
  
No between-arm differences were observed in the relapse-related variables (annual frequency of relapses, the proportion of patients without confirmed relapse, time to first relapse, and the risk of relapse).  Absence of differences caused by insufficient period to determine the dynamic of variables related to relapses.

Immunogenicity assessment
The occurrence of binding/neutralizing antibodies to IFNβ-1а was similar in all study arms. The study revealed no significant differences in the proportion of BAb/NAb-positive patients. None of BAb/NAb-positive patients relapsed over the first 16 weeks of the study.

Number of NAb-positive patients	5 (9.80%)	5 (10.20%)	2 (8.70%)	0.339
Note: 1 two-tailed exact Fisher's test.

Safety assessment
Both IFNβ-1а drugs were well tolerated and had favorable safety profiles. The statistical analysis has expectedly revealed significantly higher numbers of AEs in each IFNβ-1а arm as compared to the placebo arm (p < 0.05). However, two IFNβ-1а arms did not differ significantly from each other.    
The most common AEs in the study included local reactions, flu-like syndrome, and isolated body temperature rise that was likely a manifestation of the flu-like syndrome. The rest of AEs were reported in single cases.
