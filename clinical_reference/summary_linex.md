4.3	Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 

4.4	Special warnings and precautions for use

Before starting the therapy, the patient should consult a doctor when:
-	the body temperature is above 38 °C,
-	noticing blood or mucus in the stool,
-	diarrhoea lasts for more than two days,
-	in case of profuse diarrhoea with dehydration and loss of body weight,
-	diarrhoea is accompanied by severe abdominal pain,
-	patient have a diarrhoea and suffering from other severe underlying health condition (critical illness, presence of structural heart disease, presence of central venous catheter),
-	patient is immune-compromised (e.g. HIV infection or immunosuppressive therapy),
-	patient has a disturbed intestinal barrier (e.g. short bowel syndrome).

In the treatment of diarrhoeas, it is absolutely necessary to replace the lost fluid and electrolytes.

This product contains glucose and sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.

Paediatric population
Diarrhoeas in children younger than six years should be treated under the supervision of physician.

4.5	Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

As other bacteria, the probiotic bacteria are sensitive to antibiotics. Therefore, it is recommended to take {[Nationally completed name]} not less than 3 hours after the intake of antibiotics. 

4.6	Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

Precaution measure should be placed in case of acute diarrhoea during pregnancy and lactation to avoid liquid and electrolytes deficiency or any other undesirable effect which could endanger unborn child or pregnant woman. The alleviation of diarrhoea in pregnancy and lactation should be kept under medical supervision.

4.7	Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 

4.8	Undesirable effects

The undesirable effects arising from the use of probiotic bacteria are very rare. 
There were reports of mild gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, abdominal cramping, and gas or bloating.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

4.9	Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported.


5.	PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

5.1 	Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antidiarrheal microorganisms, Lactic acid producing organisms, ATC code: A07FA01

{[Nationally completed name]} contains live lyophilized probiotic bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus.
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG contained in {[Nationally completed name]} is the most researched probiotic bacteria and well known probiotic strain that restore and maintain intestinal microbiota balance in adults and children.
Lactobacilli (beneficial bacteria) are normally present in the human intestinal microbiota besides other bacteria. These bacteria maintain structure of the intestinal cells and their junctions, healthy acid-base balance needed for normal functioning of digestive enzymes, prevent overgrowth of harmful bacteria, influence on intestinal motility (peristalsis) and stimulate the immune system.
Disturbance of the balance of the intestinal microbiota (e.g. by viral and bacterial gastrointestinal infections, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and chemotherapeutics, irradiation of abdominal and pelvic organs and travelling abroad) may induce digestive disorders (such as meteorism, diarrhoea and constipation).
Administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is beneficial for the restoration and maintenance of the physiological balance of the intestinal microbiota. The large number of scientific publications and clinical studies on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG indicate that this probiotic strain may have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal and immune function and was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated.

5.2	Pharmacokinetic properties

A probiotic bacteria as well as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG act locally in the gastrointestinal tract; a systemic absorption does not follow oral administration. Conventional pharmacokinetic studies are thus not applicable. The gastric acid and bile resistance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG enables the strain to survive the passage through the stomach and duodenum at high percentage. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG can adhere to the intestinal mucus. Like all other microorganisms contained in the gastrointestinal tract, they are gradually removed by peristalsis and defecation.

5.3	Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenic potential.
