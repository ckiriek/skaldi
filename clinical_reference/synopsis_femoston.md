Patient
population
Female outpatients aged 40 to 59 years with the climacteric syndrome and
no vaginal bleeding since 4 months to 12 months.
Totally 150 patients are planned to be included in the study: 61 patients in
each of the two treatment groups and 28 patients in the experimental
treatment group.
Treatment
groups and
posology
Study group:
Femoston® 1 (14 tablets of 1 mg estradiol and 14 tablets of 1 mg
estradiol/10 mg dydrogesterone), film-coated tablets,
or
Femoston® 2 (14 tablets of 2 mg estradiol and 14 tablets of 2 mg
estradiol/10 mg dydrogesterone), film-coated tablets.
Note:
Initiating therapy with Femoston® 1. At Visit 2 (week 10±14 days), the
patient may be transferred to Femoston® 2.
Posology and regimen of administration are selected according to the
current Instruction for Medical Use.
Control group:
Combination therapy:
Divigel (INN Estradiol) gel for external use 0.1%
Version dated 23-JUL-2019 Page 1 of 10
and
Duphaston® (INN Dydrogesterone), 10 mg, film-coated tablets,
Note:
Starting dose of Divigel is 1 g per day which is equivalent of 1 mg of
estradiol. At Visit 2 (week 10±14 days), the dose may be corrected to 0.5
to 1.5 g per day which is equivalent to 0,5 mg to 1,5 mg of estradiol.
Dose of Duphaston® is 10 mg from 15th to 28th day of cycle.
Posology and regimen of administration are selected according to the
current Instruction for Medical Use.
The study will include an experimental group to compare the efficacy
to the two main groups described above.
Experimental group:
Patients who refused to take hormone replacement therapy and were
prescribed alternative non-hormonal therapy - Klimadynon® (INN
Cimicifuga Racemosa root extract), coated tablets.
Posology and regimen of administration are selected according to the
current Instruction for Medical Use.
Approved

Investigator decides whether a subject can take other medicinal products
which do not interfere with the study, at his/her own discretion.
Prohibited
therapy
Hormone therapy products at the inclusion in the study or during the last 3
months before the inclusion in the study and during conduct of the study
any hormonal products.

Study
procedures
The following procedures will be performed at the Screening Visit to
diagnose the climacteric syndrome:
− Inquiry of a female patient and collection of medical history with
regard to vasomotor, psycho-emotional, urogenital (including
information of last bleeding), sexual and musculoskeletal
symptoms and signs.
− Measurement of FSH levels in the blood on day 2-4 of the
menstrual cycle.
− Measurement of estradiol levels in the blood.
The following procedures will be performed at the Screening Visit to
evaluate contraindications to HRT and get initial values of the study
patients:
− Physical examination including breast palpation.
− Measurement of TSH levels in the blood.
− Measurement of prolactin levels in the blood.
− Measurement of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels.
− Measurement of (total) testosterone levels in the blood.

− Evaluation of concomitant therapy.
− Measurement of blood pressure and heart rate.
− Measurement of waist circumference, height, calculation of the
waist-to-height ratio and BMI.
− Pelvic ultrasound examination (endometrial thickness).
− Mammography (if more than 12 months have passed since the last
examination).
− Lumbar spine and femoral neck densitometry.
− Densitometry of fat tissue.

analysis
Sample size
Formal sample size calculation isn’t performed as it’s an exploratory study, with
the aim of obtaining new data for personalization of sequential hormone therapy
in perimenopausal female patients in Russia.
Based on the selected primary endpoint, as well as based on previously data (see
the table below),and taking into account SD for percentage change of hot flushes
Version dated 23-JUL-2019 Page 7 of 10
=58%, we expect that the specified sample size will allow us to detect a statistical
significant difference 27%.
