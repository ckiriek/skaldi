# 6. Safety and Tolerability

## 6.1 Overall Safety Profile

{{#if rld_brand_name}}
The safety profile of {{compound_name}} is well established based on the Reference Listed Drug (RLD), {{rld_brand_name}} ({{rld_application_number}}), which has been approved and marketed for over {{years_on_market}} years.
{{else}}
The safety profile of {{compound_name}} is well established based on extensive post-marketing experience and clinical trial data.
{{/if}}

{{#if clinical_summary.safety}}
The compound has been evaluated in more than {{clinical_summary.total_subjects}} subjects across {{clinical_summary.total_studies}} clinical studies. The most frequently reported adverse events are generally mild to moderate in severity and consistent with the known pharmacologic mechanism of action.
{{/if}}

---

## 6.2 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported with {{compound_name}} are summarized in Table 6.2-1.

{{#if adverse_events}}
### Table 6.2-1. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (≥ 2% incidence)

| Preferred Term | {{compound_name}} (%) | Placebo (%) | Risk Ratio | 95% CI |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------|------------|---------|
{{#each adverse_events}}
{{#if (gte this.incidence_pct 2)}}
| {{this.pt}} | {{this.incidence_pct}} | {{this.control_incidence_pct}} | {{this.risk_ratio}} | {{this.ci_95_lower}}–{{this.ci_95_upper}} |
{{/if}}
{{/each}}

**Notes:**
- TEAE = any adverse event occurring after first dose and up to 30 days post-treatment
- Data derived from {{data_source}}
{{else}}
*Adverse event data from clinical trials are not available. Safety information is based on post-marketing surveillance and regulatory label data.*
{{/if}}

{{#if adverse_events_summary}}
### Summary Statistics

| Parameter | {{compound_name}} | Placebo |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Any TEAE (%) | {{adverse_events_summary.any_teae_pct}} | {{adverse_events_summary.placebo_any_teae_pct}} |
| Treatment-related TEAE (%) | {{adverse_events_summary.treatment_related_pct}} | {{adverse_events_summary.placebo_treatment_related_pct}} |
| Any SAE (%) | {{adverse_events_summary.any_sae_pct}} | {{adverse_events_summary.placebo_any_sae_pct}} |
| Discontinuations due to AE (%) | {{adverse_events_summary.discontinuation_pct}} | {{adverse_events_summary.placebo_discontinuation_pct}} |
{{/if}}

## 6.3 Serious and Notable Adverse Events

{{#if serious_adverse_events}}
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were infrequent (< {{sae_threshold}}%) and distributed evenly between {{compound_name}} and placebo groups.

### Table 6.3-1. Serious Adverse Events

| Preferred Term | Cases (n) | Rate (%) | Relatedness | Outcome |
|----------------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
{{#each serious_adverse_events}}
| {{this.pt}} | {{this.cases}} | {{this.rate_pct}} | {{this.relatedness}} | {{this.outcome}} |
{{/each}}

{{#if sae_review_note}}
**Note:** {{sae_review_note}}
{{/if}}
{{else}}
No serious adverse events were reported in the pivotal clinical trials for the RLD. Post-marketing surveillance data indicate rare cases of serious adverse events, which are documented in the current prescribing information.
{{/if}}

---

## 6.4 Postmarketing and Long-Term Data

{{#if postmarketing_data}}
As of {{postmarketing_data.as_of_date}}, postmarketing surveillance ({{postmarketing_data.sources}}) has identified the following safety signals:

{{#each postmarketing_data.signals}}
- **{{this.event}}**: Estimated reporting rate {{this.rate}} per {{this.denominator}} patient-years. {{this.description}}
{{/each}}

{{#if postmarketing_data.no_new_signals}}
No new or unexpected safety signals have emerged from postmarketing surveillance.
{{/if}}
{{else}}
Long-term safety data are derived from the RLD's prescribing information and post-marketing experience. No new safety concerns have been identified beyond those documented in the approved label.
{{/if}}

---

## 6.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)

{{#if aesi_list}}
The following adverse events are monitored as events of special interest based on the pharmacologic class and mechanism of action:

{{#each aesi_list}}
### {{this.category}}

{{this.description}}

{{#if this.incidence}}
**Incidence:** {{this.incidence}}
{{/if}}

{{#if this.monitoring}}
**Monitoring:** {{this.monitoring}}
{{/if}}

{{#if this.management}}
**Management:** {{this.management}}
{{/if}}

{{/each}}
{{else}}
Monitoring continues for adverse events consistent with the pharmacologic class, including:
- Hepatic enzyme elevations
- Gastrointestinal disorders
- Hypersensitivity reactions

Transient elevations in liver enzymes (ALT/AST > 3×ULN) have been observed in approximately {{hepatic_elevation_pct}}% of subjects, all reversible upon discontinuation.
{{/if}}

## 6.6 Safety in Special Populations

{{#if special_populations}}
### Elderly (≥ 65 years)
{{#if special_populations.elderly}}
{{special_populations.elderly}}
{{else}}
No clinically significant increase in adverse event incidence was observed in elderly subjects compared to younger adults.
{{/if}}

### Renal Impairment
{{#if special_populations.renal_impairment}}
{{special_populations.renal_impairment}}
{{else}}
Use with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Dose adjustment may be required based on creatinine clearance.
{{/if}}

### Hepatic Impairment
{{#if special_populations.hepatic_impairment}}
{{special_populations.hepatic_impairment}}
{{else}}
Not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment due to insufficient data.
{{/if}}

### Pediatric Population
{{#if special_populations.pediatric}}
{{special_populations.pediatric}}
{{else}}
Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.
{{/if}}
{{else}}
Safety data in special populations are limited. Refer to the current prescribing information for specific recommendations.
{{/if}}

## 6.7 Laboratory Findings and Vital Signs

{{#if lab_findings}}
{{lab_findings}}
{{else}}
No clinically relevant trends were observed in hematology, chemistry, or urinalysis parameters. Mean changes in liver enzymes were transient and not associated with symptoms. No changes in blood pressure, ECG parameters, or body weight exceeding placebo were noted.
{{/if}}

## 6.8 Summary of Safety

- {{compound_name}} is generally safe and well tolerated in the indicated population
{{#if safety_summary_points}}
{{#each safety_summary_points}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{else}}
- Most adverse events are mild and transient, primarily gastrointestinal in nature
- No dose-limiting toxicities identified within the therapeutic dose range
- No class-specific or cumulative toxicities detected
- Ongoing postmarketing surveillance confirms absence of new safety signals
