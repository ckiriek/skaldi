## 🚨 PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT LANDING (skaldi.co)

### What's Missing:
1. **No product screenshots** - visitors can't see what they're buying
2. **No social proof** - no logos, testimonials, case studies
3. **No clear differentiation** - why Skaldi vs competitors?
4. **No pricing/CTA clarity** - what happens after "Get Started"?
5. **No trust signals** - security, compliance, team credentials
6. **Generic messaging** - doesn't speak to clinical/regulatory pain points
7. **No moat explanation** - why can't competitors copy this?

### What's Good (Keep):
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- "Done Yesterday" tagline is catchy
- Mobile responsive
- Fast loading
