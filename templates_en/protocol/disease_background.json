Instead, integrate evidence naturally into the narrative. The references provided are for your information to ensure accuracy and evidence-based content.",

The pathophysiology involves viral replication in epithelial cells, followed by retrograde transport to neuronal cell bodies where the virus remains dormant until reactivation triggers..."
